# Wildlife Aircraft Strikes Forecast
## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive analysis aimed at predicting and understanding wildlife strikes in aviation, utilizing Python for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
The dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of airplane-wildlife strike incidents involving military, commercial or civil aircraft from 1990 to 2023. The incidents were sourced from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wildlife Strike Database.

## Technical Execution
In this project, I leveraged Python and statistical techniques to analyze and forecast aviation wildlife strikes. The project involved meticulous data cleansing and in-depth analysis, ensuring high data quality and reliability. I handled data integrity and cleansing, employing custom functions for in-depth dataset assessment and optimization.
## Geospatial Analysis
A key component of this project was the geospatial analysis. Using the Cartopy library, I mapped wildlife strike incidents, revealing crucial geographical patterns and high-risk areas. This analysis not only added a spatial dimension to the data but also provided insights vital for regional safety strategies in aviation.
## Modeling and Analysis
I adeptly implemented a SARIMAX model, optimizing it through precise parameter selection. This model provided a detailed 5-year forecast, aligning closely with historical data trends.
## Model Benefits and Future Potential
The model presents significant benefits for aviation safety, offering predictive insights that could aid in proactive wildlife strike prevention. Looking ahead, I aim to enhance the model's accuracy and integrate interactive elements, expanding its utility and application in real-world scenarios.
